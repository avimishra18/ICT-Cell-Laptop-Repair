## 1. Introduction
One of my first project is a mock-up or prototype to automate the complaint registeration process. For demonstration purposes, I have modeled this as laptop repair and complaint app for the [Information Communication Technology (ICT)](https://kiit.ac.in/campuslife/ict/) cell of my university i.e. KIIT, Bhubaneshwar. The ICT cell has been set up to provide a wide range of IT services to facilitate for staffs, students and faculties.

## 2. Problem
- Students can't track the status of the repair.
- No receipts are provided for laptops which are given for repair. 

## 3. Why ICT Cell Laptop Repair App?
- App would allow the ICT cell team to:
  - Regiter a complaint by scanning the barcode of Laptop and along with student's details, in an online database.
  - Update the status of laptop repair, notify the student when repair is completed.
  - View the history of all laptops given for repair.
  
- App would allow the student to:
  - Act as receipt, that complaint has been registered alongside the date.
  - Check the status of laptop given repair. 
  - View the history of previous complaint.
